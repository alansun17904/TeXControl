# Meet TeXControl
TeXControl is a Python-based CLI that supports rapid TeX development while maintaining clean, 
loosely coupled design. It is an intelligent linker for TeX files that can conditionally link
and compile independent TeX documents. Once installed, this:
- ‚õì **Decouple large TeX files** by separating chapters or subdocuments into independent compilable 
documents that can be viewed by themselves. 
- üè∑ **Tag and sort your TeX chapters** and conditionally link these to create large dynamic
TeX files on the fly. 
- üöÄ **Includes ability to template** which super charges your TeX development. 

# Installation
TexControl requires the installation of Python 3 as well as Pip. Future versions of this project will 
be published on PyPI for easy installation. But, for now run the following commands. 

You can start by cloning the repository.
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/alansun17904/TeXControl.git 
```

Then descending into the newly cloned directory and run the installation script. 
```bash
cd TeXControl
./install.sh
```
